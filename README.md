# RNA_pipeline

This is the GitHub page for the end-to-end RNA-Seq pipeline.

For processing single-end reads and calling germline variants, please use the scripts in [single_end_germline](https://github.com/EkaRusadze/RNA_pipeline/tree/main/single_end_germline).

For processing paired-end reads and calling somatic variants, please use the scripts in [paired_end_somatic](https://github.com/EkaRusadze/RNA_pipeline/tree/main/paired_end_somatic).
